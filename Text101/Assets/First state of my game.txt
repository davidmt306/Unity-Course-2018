My squad is out of action, it's only coporal Ellis and me ,we are surrounded by zombies and I am terribly wounded. The door barricade starts to fall apart.

What should I do?

1. Make a last heroic stand and hope for the best.
2. Look for something to hold the barricade.
3. Make our way to the upper floor.
